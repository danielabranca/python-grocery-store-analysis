# Instacart Grocery Store Analysis
## Data Analysis with Python | Customer Segmentation & Sales Insights
### Project Overview

This project analyzes Instacart’s customer and sales data to uncover behavioral patterns and inform targeted marketing strategies.
Using Python (pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn) and Jupyter Notebook, I performed data cleaning, wrangling, merging, and exploratory analysis to identify customer segments and purchasing trends.

### Objective

Instacart seeks to understand the variety of customers and their shopping habits in order to:

Improve targeted marketing and ad scheduling

Identify high- and low-performing product categories

Discover when and how customers spend the most

### Key Business Questions

When do customers spend the most money?

Which product categories are most popular?

How do ordering habits differ across customer types, loyalty levels, and demographics?

### Stakeholders

VP of Marketing: Seeks improved audience targeting for ad campaigns

SVP of Sales: Aims to identify underperforming product sectors

Instacart Customers: Want personalized, relevant promotions

### Methodology & Tools

Environment: Jupyter Notebook, Anaconda

Libraries: pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, os, scipy

Key Steps:

Data importation and descriptive exploration

Cleaning: handling missing data, duplicates, and mixed types

Merging datasets and deriving new variables (e.g. loyalty flags)

Grouping, aggregating, and visualization for insights

Data ethics and reproducibility maintained throughout the workflow.

### Deliverables

Clean and merged dataset for analysis

Visualizations of order frequency, loyalty distribution, and spending habits

Final report summarizing findings and business recommendations

### Insights Summary

Revenue peaks in December, with a drop in January
